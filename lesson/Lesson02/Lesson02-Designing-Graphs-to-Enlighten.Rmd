## Numbers Worth Knowing

.vlarge[
- Categorical data: numbers that summarise (i.e. sex, property type, planning region)
    - nominal, ordinal, interval, hierarchical
    - time series
- Continuous data: numbers that measure (i.e. unit price, age, monthly salary)
    - ranking, ratio
]

---
## Data Understanding
.large[
- Avoid garbage in, garbage out problem.  For example, display size should be classified as categorical instead of continuous.]

## Pre-attentive Processing

.vlarge[
- A limited set of visual properties are processed preattentively (without need for focusing attention).

- This is important for design of visualizations
    - What can be perceived immediately?
    - Which properties are good discriminators?
    - What can mislead viewers?

# What is ChartJunk?

.vlarge[
- Chartjunk refers to all visual elements in charts and graphs that are not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph, or that distract the viewer from this information.
- It was first introduced by Edward Tufte in his 1983 book *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*.
- There is an interesting blog called [Junk Charts](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/) by Kaiser Fung.
]

---
## ChartJunk I

- Avoid using unnecessary colour shading for the bar]

## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.vlarge[
Rule 1:  If you want different objects of the same colour in a graph to look the same, make sure that the background- the colour that surrounds them – is consistent.]

.center[
![:scale 50%](img/image2-30.png)
]

---
## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.vlarge[
Rule 2:  If you want objects in a graph to be easily seen, use a background colour that constracts sufficiently with the object.]

.center[
![:scale 45%](img/image2-31.png)]

---
## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.vlarge[
Rule 3:  Use color only when needed to serve a particular communication goal.]

.center[
![:scale 40%](img/image2-32.png)]

---
## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.vlarge[
Rule 4:  Use different colours when they correspond to differences of meaning in the data.]

.center[
![](img/image2-33.png)
]

---
## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.vlarge[
Rule 5:  Use soft, natural colours to display most information and bright and/or dark colours to highlight information that requires greater attention.]

.center[
![:scale 50%](img/image2-34.png)]

---
## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.large[
Rule 6:  When using colour to encode a sequential range of quantitative values, stick with a single hue (or a small set of closely related hues) and vary intensity from pale colours for low values to increasingly darker and brighter colours for high values.]

.center[
![:scale 65%](img/image2-35.png)]

---
## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.vlarge[
Rule 7:  Non-data components of a graph should be displayed just visibly enough to perform their role, but not more so, for excessive salience could cause them to distract attention from the data.]

.center[
![:scale 65%](img/image2-36.png)]

---
## Practical Guides for Using Colour in Charts
.vlarge[
Rule 8:  To guarantee that most people who are colourblind can distinguish groups of data that are colour coded, avoid using a combination of red and green in the same display.]

## What should the relative lengths of the axis be?
.large[
- Should not manipulate the aspect ratio to intentionally exaggerate or downplay the rate of change.
- Stick to the convention of making your graphs wider than being tall.]

## When can you eliminate tick mark?
### Tick marks are superfluous on categorical scale.

## When you shouldn’t eliminate tick mark?
### Tick marks are necessary on continuous scale.

.center[
![:scale 80%](img/image2-42.png)]

---
## How many tick marks should you use?
.vlarge[
- There is no exact number that works best in all circumstances, and the size of the graph is a factor that must considered: the longer the scale line, the more tick marks it should contain.]

## Quadrant IV – Confusing yet Beautiful

.pull-left[

- Why is it “beautiful”?
    - Well placed & aligned title & lead-in
    - Attention to detail with font selection
    - Inclusion of image

- Why is it “confusing”?
    - Y-axis starts at 10K (column height misleading)
    - 3D effect makes it difficult to gage heights
    - Title & lead-in aren’t helpful]
]

## Quadrant III – Confusing and Ugly

.pull-left[
.large[
- Why is it “ugly”?
    - Horrible font & color choice
    - Grid lines are too dark & distracting
    - Format of axes (vertical x-axis labels, number format of y-axis)

- Why is it “confusing”?
    - Y-axis starts at 10K (column height misleading)
    - 3D effect makes it difficult to gage heights
    - No lead-in or call-outs to provide context
]]

.pull-right[
![](img/image2-51.png)]

## Quadrant II – Clear but Ugly

.pull-left[
.large[
- Why is it “ugly”?
    - Poor color (puke yellow?) and font (Comic Sans?) choices
    - Slightly pixelated – poor attention to image quality detail
    - Chart details – axis orientation, grid lines, outline
    
- Why is it “clear”?
    - The y-axis starts at 0 and the 2D columns are easy to gage
    - For the first time, we see call-outs of relevant events on the timeline
    - This time the lead-in paragraph is actually informative]]

.pull-right[
![](img/image2-52.png)]

---
## Quadrant I – Clear and Beautiful

.pull-left[
- Why is it “beautiful”?
    - Good font & color choices throughout
    - Soft gridlines don’t distract
    - All elements well aligned and spaced
    - High res images are “useful” chartjunk

- Why is it “clear”?
    - The y-axis starts at 0 and the 2D columns are easy to gage
    - Call-outs with images aid cognition
    - Improved title & lead-in verbiage provide further elucidation
    - For the first time, a photo credit and data source are included

# Three Bugs of Charts Interpretation

.vlarge[
- The **Patternicity** bug: We detect interating patterns, regardless of whether or not they are real.
- The **Storytelling** bug: We immediately come up with a coherent explanation for those patterns.
- The **Confirmation** bug: We start seeing all further information we receive, even the one that conflicts with our explanation, in a way that confirmed it.  We refuse to give our explanation up, no matter what.
