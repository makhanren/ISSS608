???
When a relatively large number of observation points is used, the scatterplot matrix failed to reveal the pair relationship effectively.

## Correlogram

.pull-left[
.large[
- [`Correlogram`](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/correlogram.html) uses **visual geometrics** such as ellipse, circle, square, and bars to replace the scatterplot in correlation matrix. 

- It is very useful to reveal pair-relationships between variables in a large correlation matrix. 

- In this plot, correlation coefficients is colored according to the value. 
]] 

.pull-right[
![](img/image5-4.jpg)
]

???
For positive correlation, the colour intensity change from light blue to dark blue when the correlation coefficient values increases from 0 to 1.  For negative correlation, the colour intensity change from light red to dark red when the correlation coefficient values increase from 0 to -1.
Besides colour, the shape and direction of the ellipse also used to map the correlation coefficient.  For example, the direction of the ellipses indicate positive or negative correlation and thin ellipses are shown paired variables with strong linear correlation.

## Correlogram
### Corrplot package

.pull-left[
- The correlogram on the right is produced by using R [**corrplot**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/index.html).

- The article entitle [An Introduction to corrplot Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html) provides a good overview of the functions of the package.

???
One of important feature of **corrplot** package that I enjoyed most is it's ability to reorder the correlation matrix by using selected statistical algorithms.  Currently, four methods are provided, they are: AOE, FPC, hclust, alphabet.  You can find the detail of each methods by visiting the recommended article.

## Glyphs

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Star plot (Chambers 1983)(also known as radar chart, star chart and spider chart) is a method of displaying multivariate data. 
+ The star plot consists of a sequence of equi-angular spokes, called radii, with each spoke representing one of the variables. The data length of a spoke is proportional to the magnitude of the variable for the data point relative to the maximum magnitude of the variable across all data points. A line is drawn connecting the data values for each spoke. This gives the plot a star-like appearance and the origin of the name of this plot.

## Visualising and Analysing Multivariate Data: Heatmap method

.pull-left[

- A heat map (or heatmap) is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors.

]

.pull-right[
![](img/image5-15.jpg)]

???
+ When applied to a tabular format, heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the columns and observation (or records) in row and colouring the cells within the table. 
+ Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them.
+ It is important to note that when the values are all positive or all negative, a colour scheme with different intensity should be used.  On the other hand, if the values are in both positive and negative, then, diverging colour scheme should be used.

### R packages for creating statis Heatmap 

There are many R packages and functions can be used to drawing static heatmaps, they are:

- [heatmap()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.0/topics/heatmap)of R stats package.  It draws a simple heatmap.
- [heatmap.2()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gplots/versions/3.0.1.1/topics/heatmap.2) of **gplots** R package.  It draws an enhanced heatmap compared to the R base function.
- [pheatmap()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pheatmap/versions/1.0.12/topics/pheatmap) of [**pheatmap**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pheatmap/versions/1.0.12) R package.  **pheatmap** package also known as Pretty Heatmap.  The package provides functions to draws pretty heatmaps and provides more control to change the appearance of heatmaps.
- [**ComplexHeatmap**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html) package of R/Bioconductor package.  The package draws, annotates and arranges complex heatmaps (very useful for genomic data analysis).  The full reference guide of the package is available [here](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/).
- [**superheat**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/superheat/) package: A Graphical Tool for Exploring Complex Datasets Using Heatmaps.  A system for generating extendable and customizable heatmaps for exploring complex datasets, including big data and data with multiple data types.

## Visualising and Analysing Multivariate Data
### Parallel Coordinates Plot Method

Parallel Coordinates plot or Parallel plot allows to compare the feature of several individual observations on a set of numeric variables. 

.center[
![:scale 50%](img/image5-17.jpg)]

???
Each vertical bar represents a variable and usually has its own scale. (The units can even be different). Values are then plotted as series of lines connected across each axis.
Similar to heatmap, interactivity should be used to complete the data exploration and analysis when using parallel coordinates plot.
