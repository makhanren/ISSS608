### Why Visualise Text?

.large[
- Understanding – get the “gist” of a document
- Grouping – cluster for overview or classification
- Compare – compare document collections, or
- Inspect evolution of collection over time
- Correlate – compare patterns in text to those in other data, e.g., correlate with social network

### Levels of Text Representation

.large[
- Lexical level, transforming a string of characters into a sequence of atomic entities, called tokens.
- Syntactic level, identifying and tagging (anotating) each token’s functions.
- Semantic level, extracting of meaning and relationships between pieces of knowledge derived from the structures identified in the syntactical level.

### Tag Cloud

.pull-left[
.large[
- A tag cloud (word cloud, or weighted list in visual design) is a visual representation for text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text. 
- 'Tags' are usually single words, normally listed alphabetically, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color.

## Word Tree

.pull-left[
.large[
- A visual search tool for unstructured text, such as a book, article, speech or poem. It lets you pick a word or phrase and shows you all the different contexts in which the word or phrase appears. 
- The contexts are arranged in a tree-like branching structure to reveal recurrent themes and phrases.
