The bold line indicates temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. The light solid line shows wind velocity in miles per hour.  The dotted line depicts relative humidity in percentage from readings taken at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.  Arrows portray the prevailing direction of the wind. Initials at the base of the chart show the weather conditions as follows: S, clear; PC, partly cloudy; C, cloudy; R, rain; Sn, snow.

## Line graph design tips
### Not all time-series graphs have time on the x-axis

The **connected scatter plot** below reveals changes over time by joining each time event points on the scatter plot.  The historical trail can be a effective alternative to animation.

### Candlestick chart
#### Interpreting candlestick chart

.left-column[
.large[
Candlesticks are usually composed of the body (black or white), and an upper and a lower shadow (wick): the area between the open and the close is called the real body, price excursions above and below the real body are called shadows. 
]]

.right-column[
.center[
![:scale 60%](img/image5-25.jpg)]]

???
Candlesticks are usually composed of the body (black or white), and an upper and a lower shadow (wick): the area between the open and the close is called the real body, price excursions above and below the real body are called shadows. The wick illustrates the highest and lowest traded prices of a security during the time interval represented. The body illustrates the opening and closing trades. If the security closed higher than it opened, the body is white or unfilled, with the opening price at the bottom of the body and the closing price at the top. If the security closed lower than it opened, the body is black, with the opening price at the top and the closing price at the bottom. A candlestick need not have either a body or a wick.

### Candlestick chart
#### Interpreting candlestick chart

.center[
![:scale 60%](img/image5-26.jpg)]

???
To better highlight price movements, modern candlestick charts (especially those displayed digitally) often replace the black or white of the candlestick body with colors such as red (for a lower closing) and blue or green (for a higher closing). In some East Asian countries such as Taiwan, China, Japan, and South Korea, the colouring scheme is reversed (red for higher closing, and green/blue for a lower closing).
