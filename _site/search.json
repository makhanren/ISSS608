Students should also use the assignments to gain hands-on experience on using R data visualisation and data analysis packages to complete the assignment.\r\nThe Case\r\nThe assignment topics are based on VAST Challenge 2021. You are required to choose one of the challenge topic provided below and work out the solution.\r\nIn the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.\r\nIn January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.\r\nAs an expert in visual analytics, you are called in to help law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys.\r\nMini-Challenge 1\r\nMini-Challenge 1 looks at the relationships and conditions that led up to the kidnapping. As an analyst, you have a set of current and historical news reports at your disposal, as well as resumes of numerous GAStech employees and email headers from two weeks of internal GAStech company email. Can you identify the complex relationships among all of these people and organizations?\r\nPlease visit VAST Challenge 2021: Mini-Challenge 1 for more information and to download the data.\r\nMini-Challenge 2\r\nMini-Challenge 2 asks you to analyze movement and tracking data. GAStech provides many of their employees with company cars for their personal and professional use, but unbeknownst to the employees, the cars are equipped with GPS tracking devices. You are given tracking data for the two weeks leading up to the disappearance, as well as credit card transactions and loyalty card usage data. From this data, can you identify anomalies and suspicious behaviors? Can you identify which people use which credit and loyalty cards?\r\nPlease visit VAST Challenge 2021: Mini-Challenge 2 for more information and to download the data.\r\nMini-Challenge 3\r\nMini-Challenge 3 poses a social media and text analysis challenge. You will be given a collection of microblogs and emergency calls from the days surrounding the disappearance. Can evaluate the changing levels of risk to the public and recommend actions?\r\nPlease visit VAST Challenge 2021: Mini-Challenge 3 for more information and to download the data.\r\nThe Task\r\nConducting literature review on how the analysis were performed before. The focus should be on identifying gaps whereby interactive visual analytics approach can be used to enhance user experience on using the analysis techniques.\r\nExtracting, wrangling and preparing the input data required to perform the analysis. The focus should be on exploring appropriate tidyverse methods\r\nUsing appropriate visually driven data analysis techniques to answer the questions asked.\r\nSubmission Instructions\r\nThis is an individual assignment. You are required to work on the assignment and prepare submission individually.\r\nThe assignment report must be written by using R Markdown. It can be in either Distill or blogdown format. You are required to publish the assignment report on Netlify and provide the link on the assignment submission page on elearn.\r\nUpload the assignment report and data onto your individual Github repository and provide the link on the assignment submission page on eLearn.\r\nSubmission date\r\nYour completed assignment is due on 18th July 2021 25th July 2021 (Sunday), mid-night 11:59pm.\r\nReference\r\nPast Assignment Page\r\nAY2015-16 Term 3\r\nAY2017-18 Term 3 Assignment\r\nAY2018-19 Term 1 Assignment\r\nAY2018-2019 Term 3\r\nAY2019-2020 Term 2\r\nAY2020-2021 Term 2\r\nSpecially mentioned\r\nDino Holmes Series\r\nMystery at the Wildlife Preserve\r\nVAST Challenge 2017 MC3\r\nSickness in SmartPolis\r\nSuspense at the Wildlife Preserve\r\nUnmask Air Pollution in Sofia City\r\nAssignment Submission\r\nG1\r\nAHMAD FADY GANIS\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nARCHIE QUIAMBAO DOLIT\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nARYAH UMRALKAR CHOPRA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nCHEN YUXI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nCONNIE XIA YI JING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nHONG YUN TING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nHUANG LINYA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nHUANG SHAN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nJOVINKA HARTANTO\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nKELLY KOH KIA WOON\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3\r\n\r\nKEVIN MAGIC RIALUBIN SUNGA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLI SHUXIAN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLI YUHONG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLI YUMENG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIAN YINGZHEN JOANNA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIANG YINGFANG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIM JIAHUI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIM JIN RU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIM YONG KAI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIU YANGGUANG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLOH YUN JIA STELLA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLUO HAOYU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nMANMIT SINGH S/O NARMAL SINGH\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nMAYURAPRIYANN ARULMOZHI BASKARAN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nNG DING XUAN ARNOLD\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nNG YEN NGEE\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nNIKITHA BANDA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nNURULASYIQAH BINTE MOHAMMAD TAHA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nOH YAO WEI AARON\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nONG CHEE HONG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nRHODA TONG MIN TING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nRYAN CHAN WEIYAO\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nSHEN XIAOJING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nSYED AHMAD ZAKI BIN SYED SAKAF AL-ATTAS\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify: Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3\r\n\r\nTAN CHEE SENG DAVMES\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nTAN CHOO THYE\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nTAN KAR YEE\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nWANG QINYU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nXU DAN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nYAN RUIYUN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nYANG XU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nYEO CHIA GUAN ANDY\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify Part 1 and Part 2\r\n\r\nYEO DING RUN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nYU YAXIN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nZHANG YING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nZHONG LINLI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nG2\r\nBAI YINING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nDONG FANG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nJESSICA TAN SOO CHENG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nJOYCE WOON SHI HUI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLANG SHUANG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLEE SULING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLI NAN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLI YUETING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLI ZHEN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIN PEIRONG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIU MANYE\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLIU NIAN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nLU DI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nMAO XIAOZHU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nMIAO LU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nMISHRA AMRITA\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nQIAN ZIWEI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nSNG KAH LEONG\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nTANG HUINING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nTANG YUE\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nVERTIKA PODDAR\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nWANG JIAYI\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nWANG XIYU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nYIN XIAOLAN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nZHANG XINRU\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nZHANG YOUZHEN\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\nZHONG PING\r\nAssignment write-up on Netlify\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Take your time, review them from time to time. You will find yourself learning something new each time you revisit the book.\r\nCourse Assessment\r\nThe assessment of this course consists of four major components, namely:\r\nIn-class Hands-on exercise and class participation,\r\nDataViz Makeover\r\nIndividual assignments,\r\nVisual Analytics Project.\r\nThere will be no mid-term test or final examination for this course.\r\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation\r\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\r\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of hands-on exercises using either Tableau or R. In general, these exercises are guided if Tableau is used. For R programming session, hands-on guides will be shared on RPubs before lesson starts. By the end of each lesson, students are required to upload their in-class exercise onto eLearn for reviewing. The exercises will be briefly reviewed after collection. Students will be given 10 points for correctly completing the exercise, 7-9 points for partially completed and correct work, and 0 points if absent. Up to 100 points can be accumulated during the term.\r\nDataViz Makeover\r\nEach fortnight, I will post one or two data visualisation and you are required to critic, suggest ways for improvement and rework the data visualisation. Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data. I am curious to see the different approaches you all take.\r\nThe purpose of the makeover is to improve on the original visualisation. Focus on what works, what doesn’t work, why those things don’t work, and how you made it better. You should try stick to the fields in the data set provided and improve upon the original visualisation. However, if supplementing the data helps you tell a better story, go for it!\r\nThe write-up of the DataViz Makeover must be in distill format. You are required to publish the write-up on netlify. If Tableau is used to complete the DataViz Makeover, students are require to upload their Tableau workbook onto Tableau Public.\r\nAll DataViz Makeover have to be completed by Sunday before mid-night 11.59pm. Students are required to provide the URL links on eLearn (i.e. DataViz Makeover).\r\nIndividual Assignments\r\nThere is one assignment that is due throughout the term. The assignment must be completed using R. The write-up of the assignment must be in distill format. You are required to publish the write-up on netlify. Assignment due is to be uploaded onto eLearn strictly before the official due dates. Late work will be severely penalised. Students must check and confirm on course webpage the assignment due dates.\r\nThe assignment will be graded on a scale from 0 to 100. Scores of 70 and 80 are given when the assignment is essentially done completely and correctly. Scores 80 and 90 are reserved for complete and correct homework where extra initiative or innovation clearly sets the completed work above the simple, perfunctory and satisfactory completion of the mini-assignment.\r\nVisual Analytics Project\r\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students first hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\r\nFor more details please refer to [[VAProject|Visual Analytics Project page]]\r\nGrading Summary\r\nThe grading distribution of this course is as follows:\r\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation 20%\r\nDataViz Makeover 30%\r\nAssignment 20%\r\nVisual Analytics Project 30%\r\nProject blog 15%\r\nPoster 10%\r\nPractice research paper 25%\r\nArtifact 50%\r\n\r\nThere will be no mid-term test and final examination for this course.\r\nCore Readings\r\nClaus.

A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\r\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the first week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas after the first lesson. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor before the end of Week 6. A project proposal in the form website edited using either blogdown or distill for RMarkdown on Netfily will be prepared and the link must be provided on eLearn by the end of Week 7.\r\nThe project proposal should describe the motivation of the project, problems or issues that the project will address, the relevant related work, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem, and early prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage of this proposal as a chance to get feedback on the direction of the project from their peers.\r\nStudents are required to update their project websites with all the details including the final application, user guide, poster, practice research paper by the end of week 14.\r\nProject Milestone\r\nBrainstorming project ideas and consulting with course instructor between Week 2 to Week 6.\r\nEditing and publishing project proposal by the end of Week 7.\r\nSubmission of final application, user guide, project poster, practice research paper and artifacts: 15th August 2021 by 11:59pm (mid-night)\r\nProject Deliverables\r\nProject Website\r\nProject Github\r\nAt the beginning of the project, project teams are required to create a project Github. The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\r\nProject Website\r\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using either blogdown or distill for RMarkdown. It will be disseminated by using webserver such as Netfity.\r\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the course wiki that includes:\r\nThe title of your project,\r\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\r\nThe project proposal. This should in a webblog page (remember to provide a link at the wiki).\r\nPoster\r\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\r\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\r\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\r\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\r\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\r\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\r\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\r\nSize = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\r\nResolution = 300dpi or above\r\nFile format = jpeg or pdf\r\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\r\nProject teams are encouraged to use posterdown to design your poster.\r\nNote: The poster will be considered a final deliverable, so don’t forget to apply good visual design and data visualisation principles and best practice to your poster.\r\nVisual Analytics Practice Research Paper\r\nThe research paper should be in the form of Visual Analytics Application practice and research. In particular it should contain the followings:\r\nMotivation of the application\r\nReview and critic on past works\r\nDesign framework - A detail description of the design principles used and data visualisation elements built (Refer to Section IV: Interface of this paper.\r\nDemonstration - Use case\r\nDiscussion - What has the audience learned from your work? What new insights or practices has your system enabled? A full blown user study is not expected, but informal observations of use that help evaluate your system are encouraged.\r\nFuture Work - A description of how your system could be extended or refined.\r\nThe research paper should include an abstract of not more than 300 words. The actual research paper itself should not more than 6 pages excluding figures, tables, formula and references. The practice research paper must be edited by using R Markdown and the ACM: Association for Computing Machinery template of rticles should be used.\r\nSample practice research papers\r\nDIVAD: A Dynamic and Interactive Visual Analytical Dashboard for Exploring and Analyzing Transport Data\r\nMEPHAS: an interactive graphical user interface for medical and pharmaceutical statistical analysis with R and Shiny\r\nSpatialEpiApp: A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Disease Data\r\nDeveloping web-based data analysis tools for precision farming using R and Shiny\r\nEHDViz: clinical dashboard development using open-source technologies\r\nHealth Equity Assessment Toolkit\r\nInteractive Pharmacometric Applications Using R and the Shiny Package\r\nFinal Deliverables\r\nThe final deliverable will include:\r\nartifact including the ShinyApp, data and all r modules.\r\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\r\nSample UserGuide 1\r\nSample UserGuide 2\r\n\r\nproject poster\r\na practice research paper\r\nThe final deliverable must be uploaded into the Dropbox of e-Learn (e.g. LMS). It must in a single zip file format.\r\nGrading\r\nThe visual analytics project will account for 30% of your final grade in the course. The distribution of marks for each stage of the project are as follows:\r\nProject website 15%\r\nPoster 10%\r\nPractice Research Paper 25%\r\nShinyApp 50%\r\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea (If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\r\nIn small group projects, each person will be graded individually. A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\r\nGrading criteria for poster\r\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\r\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\r\nClear communication of design approaches\r\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\r\nCraft quality of the solution\r\nSample Projects\r\nNote that the following examples are for references purposes. You are urge to use your own creativity and innovation to design the application\r\nMITB (Analytics)\r\nISSS608 Year 2013-14 Term 3B\r\nISSS608 Year 2014-15 Term 3B\r\nISSS608 Year 2015-16 Term 1\r\nOooh Shiny!\r\nKong Simi - A visual earpiece into the Singapore Parliament\r\n\r\nISSS608 Year 2016-17 Term 1\r\nProject A - The Non-Conventional Sales Dashboard for Company A\r\nDashboardViz\r\n\r\nISSS608 Year 2016-17 Term 3\r\nVRshiny: An Application for better business decision making - Visualizing Association Rules with Network Diagram in Shiny\r\nDiscovering traffic patterns by using network graph visualisations.

Like if the three members chose the same mini-challenge, they would need to pick the best part to combine in the project. And if the three members chose the three different mini-challenge, they would need to combine the three into one story in the final shiny app and the research paper.\r\n\r\nProf: Yes, the assignment should form the foundation of the project. \r\n\r\nQ2: Is there any difference in the visualisation requirements of the assignment and the project? Is shiny required for both the assignment and the project? Or we can do the assignment visualisation without the shiny?\r\n\r\nProf: For the assignment, RMarkdown should be used to prepare the answers. For the project, on the other hands, the web application should be builded by using Shiny.\r\n\r\nQ3: Are we only able to use R and R shiny in the assignment and the project? Can we use other tools in the data cleaning and the analysis?\r\n\r\nProf: You are expected to use R to complete the tasks given, including data import, integration, cleaning, wrangling and reporting.\r\n\r\nQ4: We chose mini-challenge 3 of the VAST challenge as our final project topic. During the exploration of data, we found that the data they provided is incomplete. From the file “MC3_data_readme” that describes the dataset of mini-challenge 3, it said that the data includes two types of records which are Microblog message and Call center data. However, the Call center data has not yet been provided. We also noticed that from the “Home” page of the VAST challenge website, they said, “VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 2 is now available! Additional challenges will be available for download soon!”. It seems like we still need to wait for the complete data for mini-challenge 3. Could you please tell us should we keep waiting or choose the topic from the rest mini-challenges?\r\n\r\nProf: Not true. Both data are provided in the three csv files for MC3. Please check the data carefully.\r\n\r\nQ5: I’m a little bit confused about our final project scope. Could you please tell me that does our final project needs to choose from the three mini-challenge from VAST or we need to find the data by ourselves?\r\n\r\nProf: This term, the visual analytics project must use VAST Challenge 2021 case(s). You do not have to look for your own data.\r\n\r\nQ6: Do we need to find our own dataset? Or do we solely use the data from the mini challenge?\r\n\r\nProf: You should use the data sets provided for the mini challenge\r\n\r\nQ7: Understand that the project is supposed to be an integration of the assignments we have completed. Can we understand what is the difference between the project and assignment? Do we just simply combine all of the individual assignments?\r\n\r\nProf: No, for the assignment you will address the questions using appropriate R packages and RMarkdown and for the Project, you are required to design and build web application using Shiny and R packages.\r\n\r\nQ8: Do we have to come out with a draft project proposal before scheduling a consultation?\r\n\r\nProf: Yes, you should or else there is nothing to discuss\r\n\r\nProject Groups\r\nG1\r\nGroup 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nGroup 5\r\nGroup 6\r\nGroup 7\r\nGroup 8\r\nGroup 9\r\nGroup 10\r\nGroup 11\r\nGroup 12\r\nGroup 13\r\nGroup 14\r\nGroup 15\r\nGroup 16\r\nG2\r\nGroup 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nGroup 5\r\nGroup 6\r\nGroup 7\r\nGroup 8\r\nGroup 9\r\nGroup 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
